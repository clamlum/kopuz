# Agent Development Guide

A file for [guiding coding agents](https://agents.md/). Kopuz is a Rust + Dioxus
music player; the workspace is the crates under `crates/`. See `CONTRIBUTING.md`
for the human process and `README.md` for platform setup.

## Commands

- **Serve (dev):** `just serve` — regenerates Tailwind, then `dx serve --package kopuz`.
  Debug builds use a separate `kopuz-debug.db`, so this never touches real data
  (`KOPUZ_DB_PATH` overrides the location).
- **Build (release):** `just build` (= `dx build --package kopuz --release`).
- **Lint (gate):** `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`. Run it
  in **both** debug and `--release` — some code is `cfg`-gated. Prefix with
  `SQLX_OFFLINE=true` if it tries to reach a live DB.
- **Format:** `cargo fmt --all` (check: `cargo fmt --all -- --check`).
- **Test:** `SQLX_OFFLINE=true cargo test -p <crate>`, filtering by name where you
  can — the suite is large. E.g. `cargo test -p kopuz-db <test name>`.

Run clippy (debug + release), fmt, and the tests covering your change before each commit.

## Database (`crates/db`)

- SQLite via `sqlx`. Schema migrations are `crates/db/migrations/*.sql`; sqlx
  checksums their bytes, so keep them **LF** and never edit an already-applied
  migration — add a new one.
- `query!` / `query_as!` macros are compile-checked against `crates/db/.sqlx/`.
  After adding or changing one, regenerate the cache: point `DATABASE_URL` at a
  temp DB, `sqlx migrate run`, then `cargo sqlx prepare` (run from `crates/db`).
  Runtime `sqlx::query_as` (most track queries) is not macro-checked and needs no
  prepare.
- **Crate wall:** the frontend crates (`hooks`, `pages`, `components`) reach
  the daemon through `api` and nothing else. They do not depend on `db`,
  `daemon`, `server`, `reader` or (off Android) `player`: no database handle,
  no domain model, no media source, no credentials, no system integration. A
  feature that needs one of those is a daemon service with an API method, not a
  hook. Pages render the wire rows themselves — `api::TrackInfo`,
  `AlbumInfo`, `PlaylistCatalog` — so there is no conversion layer to keep in
  step.
- **Settings file:** `AppConfig` persists to the `app_config` blob AND a
  standalone `settings.toml` next to the DB (`crates/config/src/store.rs`; the
  dead legacy store was `config.json`, which the importer renames).
  Load layers blob → file → `settings.d/*.toml` drop-ins → `KOPUZ_CONFIG_*`
  env; values travel as `serde_json::Value` and convert at the TOML edge. An
  hjem-managed file (store symlink / read-only) is never written and its keys
  render locked in the settings UI.

## Sources & covers (`crates/server`, daemon-only)

- Each backend implements the `MediaSource` trait (`source.rs`): Local, Jellyfin,
  Subsonic/Custom, YtMusic, SoundCloud, Spotify, Apple Music, Nextcloud. The
  daemon owns them; a frontend asks `SourceApi` what the active one can do
  and never branches on a service name.
- Cover resolution lives in `cover.rs` (`locate` / `track` / `from_path`);
  dispatch on the cover ref's own shape, not the active source. What a
  frontend sees is an `ArtworkRef`, resolved to bytes by `ArtworkApi`.
- **InnerTube headers are all-or-nothing.** Every `youtubei/v1/*` call sends
  `User-Agent` (from the `YouTubeClient`), `X-Goog-Api-Format-Version`,
  `X-YouTube-Client-Name`/`-Version`, `X-Origin` and `Referer`, plus
  `Cookie` + a SAPISIDHASH `Authorization` when signed in. YouTube answers a
  request missing them with a bare 403 while the endpoints that send them keep
  working from the same session, so the symptom looks like an expired login and
  is not. `discover.rs::post` is the reference; copy it rather than hand-rolling
  a builder.

## i18n (`crates/i18n`)

- Fluent `.ftl` in `crates/i18n/locales/`, baseline `en.ftl`. Add every new key to
  all locales — `scripts/check_locales.nu` (CI) requires parity with `en.ftl`, and
  `scripts/check_i18n_usage.nu` checks that keys are actually used.

## Conventions (enforced)

- Diagnostics via `tracing`; `println!` / `eprintln!` are clippy-denied outside
  explicit exceptions.
- `.clippy.toml` forbids holding a Dioxus signal borrow across `.await` — clone the
  value out first.
- Prefer real error handling over `unwrap()` / `expect()` outside tests.
- Keep comments to the non-obvious *why*; don't restate the code.

## Directory Structure

- `crates/kopuz` — app binary (Dioxus entry `main.rs`, `build.rs` font/asset
  embedding + Android packaging). Hosts the daemon core in-process.
- `crates/api` — the client-facing trait and its wire types; `crates/proto` —
  the gRPC schema; `crates/client` — the same trait over a socket.
- `crates/daemon` — the core: session, library, catalog, radio, sources,
  mutations, jobs, artwork, and `LocalApi` over them. `crates/kopuzd` — the
  headless binary and the tonic shell.
- `crates/config` — `AppConfig`, `Source`, `MusicService`, `MusicServer`.
- `crates/reader` — domain models (`Track`, `Album`, `TrackId`), scanner, tag
  IO. Daemon-side: what crosses to a frontend is `api::TrackInfo`.
- `crates/db` — SQLite backend, `ReadStore` / `Storage`, migrations.
- `crates/server` — `MediaSource` backends, sync, cover resolution.
- `crates/hooks` — Dioxus data hooks over the API (queries, player controller,
  artwork, sources).
- `crates/pages`, `crates/components`, `crates/kopuz_route` — UI + routing.
- `crates/player` audio · `crates/radio` · `crates/scrobble` · `crates/discord-presence`
  · `crates/i18n` · `crates/utils` (`CoverUrl`, image-URL builders; its cover
  cache is behind the `db-cache` feature, so a frontend never links SQLite).
- `android-src/` — Kotlin media-session classes patched in by `build.rs`.
- `packaging/` (flatpak / AUR / nix) · `scripts/` (codegen + vendor helpers).

## Issues and PRs

The bar for every issue and PR is the AI Policy in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. On top
of it, an agent:

- opens an issue or PR only when its human explicitly asks for one;
- opens PRs as drafts; the human marks them ready for review;
- keeps a PR to one behavior change, and puts a refactor the change needs in
  its own PR lower in a stack;
- fills the template as given: no added, removed or renamed headings, and no
  subheadings;
- writes Why and What Changed as behavior in a few sentences, never a
  file-by-file walk through the diff;
- turns a Testing cell from ❎ to ✅ only for a check it ran, with the
  screenshot or recording attached;
- makes follow-up commits only when its human asks, and never replies to
  reviewers;
- never adds an AI `Co-authored-by:` trailer or a "Generated with …" footer to
  a commit, issue or PR. The AI usage checkbox is the only disclosure.
