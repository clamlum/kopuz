//! "Start radio" as one action, shared by every surface that offers it.
//!
//! A track seed and a playlist seed are the same operation from the UI's side:
//! name an id, get a generated queue, play it. Keeping the label, the icon, the
//! capability gate and the notices in one place is what stops the track row and
//! the playlist surfaces from drifting apart.
//!
//! Building a mix is a remote round trip that can take tens of seconds, so it
//! announces itself: without the opening notice a click looks like it did
//! nothing, and without the failure one a timeout is indistinguishable from
//! success.
