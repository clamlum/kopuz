//! Offline copies: what is stored, what is being fetched, and asking for more.
//!
//! The downloader ran in the UI process. It built credentialed stream URLs
//! from the config, wrote files, decrypted Apple Music in the render thread,
//! and kept its own queue in a signal -- so navigating away could strand a
//! download and no second frontend could see one.
//!
//! It is a job now. What is stored comes from the daemon, and what is in
//! flight comes from that job's progress, so this is a view rather than a
//! worker.
