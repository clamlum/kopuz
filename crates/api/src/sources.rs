//! Sources as a frontend sees them: what is configured, which one is active,
//! and what each can do.
//!
//! A frontend never constructs a media source, and never names one. It reads
//! these rows to decide which affordances to render -- a delete button, a tag
//! editor, a discover tab -- renders the field lists the daemon publishes to
//! configure them, and calls the mutating methods to change what is
//! configured. No credential ever appears here; the daemon holds them.
