//! InnerTube client identities. Each entry is one of YouTube's published
//! client tuples (clientName, clientVersion, etc.); the player fallback
//! chain iterates these looking for one whose response carries plain
//! (non-signature-cipher) stream URLs.
//!
//! The constants are copied from yt-dlp's `INNERTUBE_CLIENTS` table in
//! `yt_dlp/extractor/youtube/_base.py`, which is the best-maintained record
//! of which clients YouTube still serves and what each one needs. Last
//! matched against yt-dlp 2026.08.19. When YouTube playback breaks, diff this
//! file against that table first: a client YouTube retires is usually gone
//! from yt-dlp's defaults within a day.
