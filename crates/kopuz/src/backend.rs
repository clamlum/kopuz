//! The daemon core the app talks to.
//!
//! One process: the app hosts the same core `kopuzd` runs and reaches it
//! through [`api::KopuzApi`], and serves it on the socket so other frontends,
//! `kopuzctl` and `grpcurl` can attach to the running app. Nothing is spawned
//! and nothing is supervised -- there is only one player, one library, and one
//! registration with the OS media keys.
//!
//! The core runs on its own runtime, on its own thread, for the life of the
//! process: Dioxus owns the main thread, and every service the core spawns
//! (the session actor, the reconciler, the integrations) has to outlive any
//! single UI future.
